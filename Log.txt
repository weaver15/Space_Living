Working on a controller manager for keyboard and gamepad support

3/27/19
Here is a note, always use the x86 libraries! Spent the night figuring that out the hard way

3/19/19
It has been one year and a day since I have worked on this. It never got me a job! I don't think anyone ever saw it.
I'm coming back to it now just to keep sharp and have a side project. I have updated all the libraries and have 
the git setup fixed.

3/18/18
I've been working on a lot of things and not updating this. Mostly cleaning up code and working on packaging it up to send with resumes. 

2/21/18
Changed spawning to be in 30 second waves by 3's. I can change this later to be anything.

2/14/18
Started the dialogue system. I should probably be working more on making this fun to play first. 

2/13/18
Moved the last of the xml loading methods. I need to do a little clean up before all xml loading is taken out of level class.

Cleaned up loading a little. On to Dialog or breadcrumb AI path finding. I think I would sleep better if I was just done with
the path finding crap, it drives me crazy.

2/12/18
Almost all of the loading methods are moved, I will do one pass to change how things are loaded then I'll be done
moving all these loading methods

2/11/18
Moved more of the loading methods from the level class to the info manager. I want to move a lot of 
stuff from the level to other managers such as textures should be handled by their manager and level could
just call draw. 

1/31/18
I want to start cleaning stuff up, starting with the enemy class

1/30/18
more work on enemy collision, works a little bit

1/29/18
Working on enemies not standing on top of each other. 
 
1/28/18
upped the difficulty to try to make it more fun to play. I need to get this to a point that its fun.

1/24/18
Worked on plane edit. Sort of fixed the saving method to save the right size, needs a little more work.
it saves the grid size times two for a row to account for  a number then comma but two digit numbers
mess that up. 

Cleaning up the saving method for plane edit

1/23/18
Frames per seconds capped

1/9/18
fixing searching to include doors, it seems like its an infinite loop right now

1/8/18
Search to include solid objects like doors

1/7/18
Removed the options option from the start screen until I can actually add something for it. 
Enter to progress screens instead of any button.
Added how to play description 
Added use E to open doors to the controls page


1/4/18
Doors reset, I upped the search timer and reworked the timer object too. Seem a little better but I still think it is 
calling the A* search too much. I want to call it  around every 2 seconds if i absolutely have to. It shouldn't cause 
a noticeable lag though but it does. Something not right and I'm too scared to look at that code again :(

I broke the Start and Exit menu because Megan said having Option there and not doing anything with it was 
confusing. 

12/28/17
added more spawn points, moved boss key to a good location

12/27/17
Fixed spawn reset, fixed door collision, stop spawn points when they are too far away

12/26/17
Added a screen to show controls, credits and game over. Credits and game over don't show yet.
The game state switches to game over when the player is no longer alive
when the players health is 0 shows the game over scree, then goes to the star game screen where the level can begin again
Added a Reset to level to reset the player, enemies, and spawns. Need to reset the boss and boss key. Fix the spawns
because they don't spawn after reset


12/19/17
Taking the path from the spawn to the player, finding where the enemy fits in that path and setting that as
the enemies path

12/18/17
Ive been working on the loading mostly. Made a GameInfo class for loading and will be
used for saving in the future. There is still more to do with that but I need to work on something
else and switched over to constructing a path from the spawn point that all enemies will walk on.

Also encapsulation is kind useless when I'm the only one working on this so I'm removing that as I 
see it. 

12/7/2017
I went to Cabo for a week. This week and previous few days I have been moving xml loading from Level to a 
GameInfoManager I made to handle loading and saving. 

11/19/17
Moved the dropped item image to the tile map. Dropped items and boss key both draw
Starting to set get methods to const
I have a lot of methods I don't use, I'm cleaning that up too as I find them.

11/17/17
I did some work on the map editor now I'm back. Ive done a bad job logging what I've done.
Drew the boss key for the door.
Added dropped item texture to the import xml it was hard coded.
Dialog box pops up with the door cost when the player is close to a door.


8/29/17
Worked on some distance stuff. I think I'm going to go back to map editor

8/28/17
Exit on the start screen exits, in the future it will need a confirmation screen. 
Moved enums around a little, slowly cleaning things up

7/20/17
enter on start on the start screen starts the first level, small I know

7/10/17
W and S move the cursor, I need to re draw the screen

7/7/17
the start screen bmp is a different size than the screen and is stretched to it
so finding a way to keep the cursor centered and under the correct object

7/6/17
Import screen options from game info
Load options array
made a screen options enum with Start, Options, Exit

adjusting the menu selector class used in the inventory to be used for the cursor, it loads and draw just needs to draw in the right
place and take input

7/5/17
Enter changes screen from start screen to level

Drew temp cursor
Made a options struct for Start, Options, Exit
Made a Cursor class

7/4/17
start screen draws to the size of the screen

6/29/17
Got the start screen to draw

6/28/17
Start screen constructor, draw and update
Moved some texture methods to the texture object from level
removed not needed field from level

6/27/17
Switch on game state, update game state in updates 

6/26/17
Start Screen class, game state enum to control start screen, level, game over or credits

6/20/17 - 6/23/17
PlaneEdit
-Clicking a button then the grid changes the tile to the image, sets the tile
to the image type export too. Works well but the refresh after each click is
noticeably slow for some reason? 

6/19/17
PlaneEdit
-Panel with buttons

6/18/17
Made a mock start screen. 

6/10/17-6/16/17
Started working on a map editor called PlaneEdit for now. Right now it loads all white tiles, clicking them turns them black. 
Save saves the tiles as either a 0 or 1 in the game info format. 

5/5/17
6:20 - 7
Player collision with solid objects

5/4/17
6:20 - 7

Added solid objects to the level and they draw, need collision next

5/3/17
7:30 - 8, 8:40 - 9:15
fixed horizontal doors
tried to make the level a little better
found a A* bug 

4/24/17
9-9:30
I think I fixed the bug by blanking out the enemy path every time I set it.
Set the drop chance for enemies so they don't drop items 100% of the time

4/23/17
9-9:30
tried to fix a bug (didn't). It comes from killing an enemy and a new one spawning or the path be access on a dead one?

4/22/17
Added some debugging to enemy manager

4/21/17
threaded all of the enemy searching, i think it works?

4/20/17
Attempted to do threads, didn't work for enemies. I'll keep them in mind for somewhere else
Started to outline the layout of the story

4/13/17
Cleaned up the enemy and enemy manager some...probably broke it

4/10/17

working on more efficient AI

4/4/17
8:30 - 10 pm
working on if the enemy is within sight (a line between the player and enemy) of the player, don't A* just move to that location. It needs improvement but wasnt too bad for the first run.
Decreased max enemies to 10


4/3/17
6:15 - 7
Added a timer to enemies, works fine but still laggy with a lot of enemies on screen. Wanted to know if it was just debug build so I went through getting a release build, getting a sdl not installed error on run. Builds fine

3/31/17
6:15-7
Slowed down the search rate but messed up and it only updates one. The timer needs to be attached to the enemy not enemy manager

3/30/17
6:20 - 7
I didn't do much, just moved level update stuff around and planned on how to update each enemy

8:30 - 9:20
hooked up A* to spawning enemies....runs so slow haha, will have to update how often a* is updated

3/29/17
6:15 - 7
Re-worked is passable to take into account current tile and next tile, it worked when ran on a regular unobstructed path. I'll see what it does with a wall in the way tonight

8:30-9:15
A* test worked! To celebrate I just cleaned up Level a little bit

3/28/17
A* search, my grid needs to include doors, discovered late last night that the problem was the enemy would never go to a tile with walls and my player was on a tile with walls.

3/27/17
I'm spending most of my time looking over this search, and thats probably what I'll always do

3/26/2017
8:30-9
The neighbor method is messed up. If moving down the enemy can hit tiles with up walls, moving right they can hit tiles with left walls.
I need to work out the get neighbor / is passable. 

3/24/17
A* will eventually get the enemy to the player so I switched to a priority grid and that works better but walls still get in the way
If the enemy reaches the player its at 'goal' this will break the search

3/16/17
8-8:30
Got the path finding sort of working, its not putting the right points though

3/15/17
8-10
I took a break to play Persona 3 before Persona 5 comes out. I broke my heart not to be working on anything so I'm back.

Reading in the slots for equipment inventory
Setting equipped inventory in proper location, well atleast for weapon 1 slot. I need to add the other items to drop befor testing them for the 
other slots

Next: have over items drop, start a loot table

9/19/2016
15 mins

Just to say I did something today I mapped out the slot locations for the equipment texture, this way they can be read in
then used to place the item in the right locations.

Tomorrow I would like to read them in and have them placing items correctly

9/14/2016
I have this great idea, before finishing one game I'm going to work on two at the same time. So they are both finished together

Note:
I need to make sure everything is cleaned up before I start to do anything else,
to avoid future bugs and debt

I dont want you to think I'm slacking. I have been working more on unity and unreal lateley
Tonight I started a clean up, I hated my naming convention so I'm starting to change it. I noticed lots of redundant code
so Im changing that. Such as check collision is the same for everything so that needs to be moved to Animated Object class

Horizontal walls read in fine now, they are just untextured SDL_Rect...this will work for my first game
Next:
Read and applay vert walls

8/14/2016
8:30 pm - 10:17 pm
Working on listing all the walls that need to be added
Started to parse, wall coords are still 0, probably just a xml read in problem somewhere

8/11/2016
7:41pm - 8:36 pm
Added openGL and freeglut to the project
Spent the rest of the time researching how to repeat the wall texture (didnt exactly figure it out)

8/9/2016 
8:11pm - 9pm
Added WallManager class
added wall collision for player
removed event passing to player update

Next:
	start maping out where the walls will be for level 1

Starting with drawing a wall texture
Added dimenstions to GameInfo
Made a Wall class and loaded wall information
drew a temp wall and it worked but I dont like how small it is

Fixed:
	Added an animated object constructure that will default row col to 1,1
	Changed a few places where nodes where getting created to be created at the last possible moment
	
Next:
	Work on walls, collision and size.
	Wall manager

Note: I watched a lot of the olympics tonight

8/7/2016 

6:45 pm - 8:12 pm
Fixed:
	Renamed LevelInfo to GameInfo to keep all game info in one file
	Menu selector wasnt reflecting input until inventory was turned off and redrew, fixed that
	Added initialize values for projectiles
	Added initialize values for inventory menu
Next:
	Start on walls

6:30 am - I don't like the look of most of my code. A lot of it was just thrown together to get something to work.
I'm going to start cleaning up a class a day in addition to making additions. Todays clean up with start
with the player class. 
8:40 pm - 9:30 pm
-Fixed:
	Projectiles were subtracting from the right spot when moving out of bounds, fixed the pointer problem there
	Move fire projectile logic from the player to projectile manager to clean up a litte bit.
	Discoved that enemies stop spawning because they are just set to walk left, and they have no out of bounds, I dont think
		this needs any work because eventually they wont walk out of bounds.
-Next:
	Add a wall
	add a secod xml for texture info thats not level dependent
	fix the initializes for inventor and projectile in player
		add texture info for both
		read it in
		send it to the player to init both


8/3/2016 
8:00 - 9:18
-Fixed:
	Inventory item draw location
	Changed draw order so Player is usually on top
	Moved set inventory locations to be called once instead of ever draw cycle
	Increased the max number of items dropped on screen
-Next:
	Bug: bullets and enemies stop shooting/fireing after a while
